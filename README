This plugin saves and restores your view, preserving cursor positions and folds. 
It's quite simple, but it takes steps to avoid throwing errors when views no
longer exist or have been changed unexpectedly. 

If you want more elaborate session management, the `gitsessions` plugin might
appeal to you:

This is based on (or rather, currently, identical to!) Yichao Zhou's plugin here:
